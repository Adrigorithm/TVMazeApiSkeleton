# TVMazeAPISkeleton

I really couldn't come up with a better name. This is a flutter project with minimal coverage of the TVMaze API, as the name suggests.

## Getting Started

You can clone this I guess, setup your working env using the official documentation (link below). I recommend using VSCode, "It just works", especially if your pc runs on Linux (If you use Vim I will visit you at night >:) ).

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Main Features

The homescreen prsents you with a list of shows (ENDPOINT: api.tvmaze.com/shows)

Additionally, the homescreen has a search function.

Prefixing with an asterix (*) will search only through favourites.

When one of the shows is being clicked on you are transferred to the corresponding details page (this does not make additional API calls).
