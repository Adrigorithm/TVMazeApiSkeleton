# flutter_test_1

Yeah the name sucks, I will change this sometime (maybe).
This app does what the repo description says.
Nothing else really.

## Getting Started

You can clone this I guess, setup your working env using the official documentation (link below). I recommend using VSCode, "It just works", especially if your pc runs on Linux (If you use Vim I will visit you at night >:) ).

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
